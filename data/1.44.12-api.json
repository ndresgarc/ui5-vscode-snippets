They can also navigate\ndirectly from one month or year to another.\n<br><br>\n<b>Note:</b> The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the\n<code>DateRangeSelection</code> is opened (not used for the initial rendering).\nIf the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library is not loaded before the\n<code>DateRangeSelection</code> is opened, it will be loaded upon opening.\nThis could lead to a waiting time when the <code>DateRangeSelection</code> is\nopened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the\n<code>DateRangeSelection</code> should also load the <code>sap.ui.unified</code>\nlibrary.\n<br><br>\n<b><i>Usage</i></b>\n<br><br>\n<i>When to use</i>\n<br>\nIf you need a time range and know that your user is a power user who has to\ninput lots of data. If the keyboard is the primary device used for navigating\nthe app, use two input fields. This allows the user to quickly jump from field\nto field. By selecting a date in one of the fields, the other field should\nrecognize the information and jump to the same selection.\n<br><br>\n<i>When not to use</i>\n<br>\nIf the user's primary goal is not to select ranges or if you just want to enter\na date and a time. For such cases, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker} or\n{@link sap.m.TimePicker}.\n<br><br>\nThe user can enter a date by:\n<ul>\n<li>Using the calendar that opens in a popup</li>\n<li>Typing it in directly in the input field (not available for mobile\ndevices)</li>\n</ul>\nOn app level, there are two options to provide a date for the\n<code>DateRangeSelection</code> - date range as a string to the\n<code>value</code> property or JavaScript Date objects to the\n<code>dateValue</code> and <code>secondDateValue</code> properties (only one of\nthese options should be used at a time):\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <code>value</code> property if the date range is already provided as\na formatted string</li>\n<li>Use the <code>dateValue</code> and <code>secondDateValue</code> properties\nif the date range is already provided as JavaScript Date objects or you want to\nwork with JavaScript Date objects</li>\n</ul>\n<b><i>Formatting</i></b>\n<br><br>\nAll formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the\n{@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}. If a date is entered by typing it into\nthe input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.\n<br><br>\nSupported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation.\nSee {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}\n<br><br>\nFor example, if the <code>displayFormat</code> is \"MMM d, y\", delimiter is \"-\",\nand the used locale is English, a valid value string is \"Jul 29, 2015 - Jul 31,\n2015\" and it is displayed in the same way in the input field.\n<br><br>\nIf no placeholder is set to the <code>DateRangeSelection</code>, the used\n<code>displayFormat</code> is displayed as a placeholder. If another placeholder\nis needed, it must be set.\n<br><br>\n<b>Note:</b> If the string does NOT match the <code>displayFormat</code>\n(from user input) or the <code>valueFormat</code> (on app level), the\n{@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the\nlocale settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the\nAPI Reference.\n<br><br>\n<b><i>Responsive behavior</i></b>\n<br><br>\nThe <code>DateRangeSelection</code> is fully responsive. It is smaller in\ncompact mode and provides a touch-friendly size in cozy mode.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","properties":[{"name":"delimiter","type":"string","defaultValue":"-","group":"Misc","visibility":"public","description":"Delimiter between start and end date.

It consists of two parts: the input field and the\ndate/time picker.\n<br><br>\n<b>Note:</b> The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the\n<code>DateTimePicker</code> is opened (not used for the initial rendering). If\nthe <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library is not loaded before the\n<code>DateTimePicker</code> is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This\ncould lead to a waiting time when the <code>DateTimePicker</code> is opened for\nthe first time. To prevent this, apps using the <code>DateTimePicker</code>\nshould also load the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library.\n<br><br>\n<b><i>Usage</i></b>\n<br><br>\nUse this control if you need a combined date and time input control.\n<br>\nDon't use it if you want to use either a date or a time value. In this case,\nuse the {@link sap.m.DatePicker} or the {@link sap.m.TimePicker} controls\ninstead.\n<br><br>\nThe user can enter a date by:\n<ul>\n<li>Using the calendar or a time selector that opens in a popup</li>\n<li>Typing it in directly in the input field</li>\n</ul>\nOn app level, there are two options to provide a date for the\n<code>DateTimePicker</code> - as a string to the <code>value</code> property\nor as a JavaScript Date object to the <code>dateValue</code> property (only one\nof these properties should be used at a time):\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <code>value</code> property if you want to bind the\n<code>DateTimePicker</code> to a model using the\n<code>sap.ui.model.type.DateTime</code></li>\n<li>Use the <code>value</code> property if the date is provided as a string from\nthe backend or inside the app (for example, as ABAP type DATS field)</li>\n<li>Use the <code>dateValue</code> property if the date is already provided as a\nJavaScript Date object or you want to work with a JavaScript Date object</li>\n</ul>\n<b><i>Formatting</i></b>\n<br><br>\nAll formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the\n{@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}. If a date is entered by typing it into\nthe input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.\n<br><br>\nSupported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation.\nSee {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}\n<br><br>\nFor example, if the <code>valueFormat</code> is \"yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss\", the\n<code>displayFormat</code> is \"MMM d, y, HH:mm:ss\", and the used locale is\nEnglish, a valid value string is \"2015-07-30-10-30-15\", which leads to an output\nof \"Jul 30, 2015, 10:30:15\".\n<br><br>\nIf no placeholder is set to the <code>DateTimePicker</code>, the used\n<code>displayFormat</code> is displayed as a placeholder. If another placeholder\nis needed, it must be set.\n<br><br>\n<b>Note:</b> If the string does NOT match the <code>displayFormat</code>\n(from user input) or the <code>valueFormat</code> (on app level), the\n{@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the\nlocale settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the\nAPI Reference.\n<br><br>\n<b><i>Responsive behavior</i></b>\n<br><br>\nThe <code>DateTimePicker</code> is responsive and fully adapts to all devices.\nFor larger screens, such as tablet or desktop, it opens as a popover.

Expendable panels are enabled by the <code>expandable</code> property.\nFurthermore you can define an expand animation with the property <code>expandAnimation</code>.\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<h4>When to use:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to group or display information and want to give users the option of hiding this information.</li>\n<li>You want to show additional information on demand (for example, a panel could show optional input fields for an advanced search).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Responsive Behavior</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If the width of the panel is set to 100% (default), the panel and its children are

expandable, an arrow icon (pointing to the right) appears in front of the header.</li>\n<li>When the animation is activated, expand/collapse uses a smooth animation to open or close the content area.</li>\n<li>When the panel expands/collapses, the arrow icon rotates 90 degrees clockwise/counter-clockwise.</li>\n<li>When the height uses the default property <code>auto</code>, the height of

If you want the user to\nselect a duration (1 hour), use the {@link sap.m.Select} control instead.\n<br><br>\nThe user can enter a date by:\n<ul>\n<li>Using the <code>TimePicker</code> dropdown that opens in a popup</li>\n<li>Typing it in directly in the input field</li>\n</ul>\nOn app level, there are two options to provide value for the\n<code>TimePicker</code> - as a string to the <code>value</code> property or as a\nJavaScript Date object to the <code>dateValue</code> property (only one of these\nproperties should be used at a time):\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <code>value</code> property if you want to bind the\n<code>TimePicker</code> to a model using the\n<code>sap.ui.model.type.Time</code></li>\n<li>Use the <code>value</code> property if the date is provided as a string from\nthe backend or inside the app (for example, as ABAP type DATS field)</li>\n<li>Use the <code>dateValue</code> property if the date is already provided as a\nJavaScript Date object or you want to work with a JavaScript Date object</li>\n</ul>\n<b><i>Formatting</i></b>\n<br><br>\nAll formatting and parsing of values from and to strings is done using the\n{@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}.

For more information, see the respective documentation in the\nAPI Reference.\n<br><br>\n<b><i>Responsive behavior</i></b>\n<br><br>\nThe <code>TimePicker</code> is responsive and fully adapts to all device types.\nFor larger screens, such as tablet or desktop, it opens as a popover.
